                <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them. <br><br>
                At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

                <p>Aida is an almost 4 year old American Shorthair cat. Aida loves to relax and sleep on the couch. She used to prefer napping on her owner Christine's bed, but these days, she loves resting on the couch near the fireplace. Aida is always on the lookout for treats. But she usually has to do a trick in order to earn a treat!
                <br><br>
                Aida lives for attention. When her owner is trying to practice stretching, she loves to distract her by asking for cuddles!</p>
